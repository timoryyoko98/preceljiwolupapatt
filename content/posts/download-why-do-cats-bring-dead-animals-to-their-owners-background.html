    <p><strong>Download Why Do Cats Bring Dead Animals To Their Owners Background</strong>. Additionally, cats are pack animals, and they often want to share their bounty with their family.

    <p>Rodents had become a problem for early farmers who stored grains for their livestock and cats were an amazing answer. For example, mother cats bring food to their babies.

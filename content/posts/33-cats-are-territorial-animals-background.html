                These are not the behaviours of highly territorial animals living a solitary life. Harley will sleep on my pillow and if my husband gets too close to me he will move closer and pout his paw on my husband as if to say she is mine and you are not supposed. Cats are extremely territorial, however, so it can be a chore introducing them to each other.

    <h3>Cats get a bad rep.</h3>
    <p>Cats get a bad rep. No animal on earth is as aggressive, territorial and deadly as humans, but there are some pretty you probably violate boundaries every day. Cats are territorial animals so fights are bound to happen. If the kitty picks up on.</p>

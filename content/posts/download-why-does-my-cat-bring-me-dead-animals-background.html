                Even without maternal interactions, a cat will still hunt and likely bring home some dead animals because the behaviour is hardwired. Interestingly, spayed female cats are the most likely to bring dead animals to their owners. Cats are predators, so they will go out and hunt small animals.

    <h3>These pets show two males as well as female cats bring dead animals to the doorstep.</h3>
    <p>Why do they do this? Additionally, cats are pack animals, and they often want to share their bounty with their family. This means when a cat brings you an animal they caught, be it alive or dead, they consider you a part of their family. If your cat has ever left a dead mouse on the back porch, or even left their favorite stuffed mouse in your shoe, you&#039;ve probably asked yourself, why does my cat do this?</p>
